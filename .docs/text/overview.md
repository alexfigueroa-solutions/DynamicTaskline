## Introduction

Traditional CLI tools are linear and static, lacking the dynamism required by today's complex and fast-paced workflows. Our system reinvents the CLI experience by incorporating a tree-structured task management with real-time updates and intelligent, context-aware interactions.

## System Overview

At its core, the CLI UX/UI system is built on a modular architecture that separates tasks into a navigable tree structure. Each node represents a task with its own contextual information, allowing users to traverse, monitor, and manage workflows non-linearly.

The system is divided into two main panels:

1. **Task Panel (Top)**: Displays the task hierarchy and status.
2. **Information Panel (Bottom)**: A minimalistic, one-line height display for user inputs, system-wide notifications, and real-time feedback.

## Installation

> *Note: Detailed installation instructions will be provided once the system reaches a stable release version.*

## Usage

> *Note: Comprehensive usage guidelines will be included after finalizing the system's interactive commands and shortcuts.*

## Features

### Task Hierarchies

Navigate complex task trees with ease, thanks to our intuitive and responsive UI that reflects real-time status changes, task dependencies, and outcomes.

### Contextual Information Management

Task nodes store and display relevant information, ensuring that you have all the context you need without clutter or confusion.

### Intelligent Predictive Execution

Our system anticipates your needs, offering suggestions and automating repetitive tasks to streamline your workflow.

### Adaptive Notification System

Receive important updates without disruption. The information panel is designed to keep you informed without breaking your focus.

## Design Philosophy

We believe in enhancing the CLI experience by making it more intuitive, informative, and responsive to the user's needs. Our design philosophy centers around the idea that a tool should adapt to the user, not the other way around. We aim to maintain the core functionality of a CLI while transforming the feedback loop into something far more engaging and efficient.
