# DynamicTaskLine Module Development Documentation

## Overview

`DynamicTaskLine` is a Python module aimed at providing a robust command-line interface (CLI) for real-time task management. It will offer a structured way to define tasks, manage their execution, provide real-time status updates, and allow data to be passed from one task to another.

## Module Structure

The `DynamicTaskLine` module consists of several components that work together to manage tasks:

- **Task Manager**: Central component that handles task execution and status updates.
- **Task**: Represents a single task with its own execution logic and status.
- **SubTask**: Inherits from `Task`, designed for nested tasks.
- **UI Renderer**: Manages dynamic rendering of task statuses in the CLI.
- **Data Handler**: Ensures data output from tasks is correctly passed to subsequent tasks or subtasks.
- **CLI Parser**: Handles user input and interactive configuration through the CLI.
- **Config Manager**: Manages project configuration settings.

## Component Details

### Task Manager

The Task Manager is responsible for orchestrating the execution of tasks and updating their statuses. It keeps track of all tasks and their hierarchy.

#### Functionalities

- Initialize tasks and subtasks.
- Execute tasks in the defined order.
- Update and render task statuses in real time.
- Handle data propagation between tasks.
- Provide hooks for error handling and logging.

### Task

The Task component is an abstract representation of a task with properties such as `title`, `status`, and `result`.

#### Functionalities

- Define execution logic.
- Update task status (e.g., pending, in progress, completed, failed).
- Store execution result or output.
- Optionally, hold a list of subtasks.

### SubTask

SubTask extends the functionality of Task, allowing for the creation of nested task structures.

#### Functionalities

- Inherit all functionalities from `Task`.
- Be initiated and managed by a parent task.

### UI Renderer

The UI Renderer is responsible for the real-time rendering of task statuses on the CLI.

#### Functionalities

- Listen for status updates from tasks.
- Render task statuses to the console dynamically.
- Support various UI components like progress bars, spinners, and color-coded statuses.

### Data Handler

The Data Handler component ensures the smooth flow of data between tasks.

#### Functionalities

- Receive output from a completed task.
- Validate and pass data to the next task or subtask.
- Handle data transformation if necessary.

### CLI Parser

The CLI Parser interprets user input and translates it into task configurations.

#### Functionalities

- Parse CLI arguments and flags.
- Offer interactive prompts for user input.
- Validate user input before task execution.

### Config Manager

The Config Manager maintains project-specific settings that may be used by tasks during execution.

#### Functionalities

- Load and parse configuration files.
- Provide a CLI interface for updating configuration settings.
- Ensure configuration consistency across tasks.


## Subcomponents and Utilities

- **Logger**: To log events, errors, and information.
- **Error Handler**: To manage and respond to errors during task execution.
- **Event Emitter**: To handle event-driven aspects like status updates and data flow.
- **Test Suite**: For unit and integration testing of components.

## Development Process

1. **Design Phase**: Outline the detailed specification of each component.
2. **Prototype Phase**: Develop a basic working model for task execution and status updates.
3. **Implementation Phase**: Build out each component as per specifications.
4. **Testing Phase**: Write and execute tests for all components and their interactions.
5. **Documentation Phase**: Create comprehensive documentation for each component and the module as a whole.
6. **Review & Refinement Phase**: Review the module, refine based on feedback, and ensure code quality and performance.
7. **Release Phase**: Prepare the module for release on PyPI.

## Building the Module

Developers should:

- Use `setuptools` for packaging the module.
- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
- Implement continuous integration (CI) for automated testing.
- Use `Sphinx` or similar tools for generating documentation.
- Ensure the module is compatible with the major Python versions (3.7 and above).

By adhering to this documentation, developers will be able to build, maintain, and extend the `DynamicTaskLine` module effectively.
