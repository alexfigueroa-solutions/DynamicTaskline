# DynamicTaskLine: Comprehensive Requirements and Feature Documentation
## 1. Introduction
DynamicTaskLine is an advanced Python library engineered to revolutionize the traditional command-line interface (CLI) by introducing a dynamic, structured, and interactive environment, ideal for managing complex workflows.

## 2. Detailed Requirements
### 2.1 Functional Requirements
#### Hierarchical Task Management:
- Capability to create, manage, and display tasks and subtasks in a parent-child hierarchy.
- Visual representation of the task hierarchy in the CLI environment.

#### Real-Time Feedback:
- Immediate visual updates on the status of each task, including progression, completion, and error states.
- Integration of progress bars or similar indicators for ongoing tasks.

#### Contextual Information and Error Display:
- Systematic arrangement of logs and error messages within the context of the relevant tasks.
- Enhanced readability and searchability of logs for efficient debugging.

#### Interactive Configuration:
- Facilities for users to adjust task parameters and settings in real-time, based on evolving requirements or conditions.
- Immediate reflection of configuration changes in the task's execution and display.

#### Nested CLI Outputs:
- Isolation and organization of outputs from individual tasks or subtasks, ensuring clarity in the display of information.
- Prevention of output overlap between different tasks.

#### Dual-Panel UI Layout:
- A split-view interface with a Top Panel occupying 95% of the terminal space for task display, and a Bottom Panel taking up the remaining 5% for global status updates, indicators, and user input.
- The Bottom Panel acts as a Quick Action Center, enabling efficient interaction and real-time monitoring.

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
#### Usability:
- Development of an intuitive, user-friendly interface.
- Provision of comprehensive documentation and user guides

#### Performance:
- Optimization for low-latency updates and handling a high volume of tasks without significant performance degradation.

#### Scalability:
- Design that supports easy integration of future enhancements and features.
- Ability to handle an increasing load of tasks and complexity without loss of performance or usability.

#### Reliability:
- Assurance of stable and consistent operation under expected loads and conditions.
- Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms to maintain system integrity.

#### Security:
- Implementation of best practices in security to safeguard against vulnerabilities.
- Regular updates and patches to address any identified security concerns.

## 3. Comprehensive Feature Description
### Hierarchical Task Management:
- Implementation of a tree data structure for managing tasks and subtasks, with intuitive navigation and manipulation capabilities.
- Visual differentiation between different levels of tasks for easy identification and management.

### Real-Time Feedback:
- Deployment of an event-driven model to provide live updates on tasks' statuses.
- Use of asynchronous programming techniques to manage real-time updates without blocking other processes.

### Contextual Information and Error Display:
- Design of an integrated logging system that attaches logs and errors to their corresponding tasks, facilitating easier debugging and problem resolution.
- Error propagation mechanisms to ensure that issues at lower levels of the task hierarchy are reported and visible at higher levels.

### Interactive Configuration:
- Creation of dynamic input parsers and a configuration API to allow for real-time adjustments to tasks.
- Utilization of libraries such as Click or PyInquirer for enhanced CLI interaction, enabling dynamic responses to user input.

### Nested CLI Outputs:
- Development of a system to segregate and manage the outputs of different tasks and subtasks, ensuring a clean and organized interface.
- Implementation of buffering techniques to handle multiple simultaneous outputs.

### Dual-Panel UI Layout:
- Development of a responsive UI layout that dynamically adjusts to terminal sizes while maintaining the designated space allocation for the Top and Bottom Panels.
- Integration of a global input listener and a dedicated UI component in the Bottom Panel for handling and displaying user inputs and global status updates.
