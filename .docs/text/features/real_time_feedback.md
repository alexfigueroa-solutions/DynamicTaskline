# Real-Time Feedback Feature for DynamicTaskLine

The **Real-Time Feedback** feature is a core aspect of the **DynamicTaskLine** library that greatly enhances user interaction by providing immediate feedback from tasks as they are executed. This feature is critical for maintaining awareness of the state of operations, especially when dealing with complex, long-running tasks.

## Architectural Integration with DynamicTaskLine

To implement real-time feedback within the **DynamicTaskLine** framework, the feature will be integrated into the existing task execution flow. The architecture will ensure that updates from tasks are pushed to the display layer without blocking the execution of tasks.

### Components

- **Output Stream Manager**: Manages the standard output and error streams to reflect real-time task statuses.
- **Feedback Controller**: A new module that interfaces with the `TaskManager` to provide real-time updates and manages user interactions for live feedback.
- **Status Renderer**: Renders task statuses, progress bars, or other indicators and updates them in real-time.

### Key Functions and Classes

- **`FeedbackStream`**: A class that encapsulates the logic for capturing and displaying feedback from tasks.
- **`ProgressIndicator`**: Provides visual feedback on the progress of tasks, such as spinners or progress bars, and is updated in real-time.

## Implementation Details

To facilitate real-time feedback, **DynamicTaskLine** will employ asynchronous programming techniques. Hereâ€™s a simplified implementation outline:

```python
from dynamictaskline import TaskManager, Task
from dynamictaskline.feedback import FeedbackStream, ProgressIndicator
import asyncio

# Initialize the TaskManager with real-time feedback enabled
manager = TaskManager(enable_real_time_feedback=True)

@manager.task(title="Data Processing Task")
async def data_processing_task(data, feedback: FeedbackStream):
    progress = ProgressIndicator(total=100)
    feedback.set_progress_indicator(progress)

    for i in range(100):
        # Simulate data processing
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)  # Non-blocking sleep
        progress.update(1)  # Update progress for real-time feedback
        feedback.send(f"Processed batch {i+1}")

    progress.complete()  # Mark progress as complete

# Execute the task manager with asyncio event loop
asyncio.run(manager.run())
```

## Testing Strategies

Testing the real-time feedback feature will involve both unit and integration tests:

- **Unit Tests**: Verify individual components such as `FeedbackStream` and `ProgressIndicator` for correct behavior.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure that when tasks are executed, feedback is correctly displayed and updated in the CLI without errors.

Mocking and patching I/O operations will be necessary to simulate the CLI environment and real-time updates without actual task execution during tests.

## Documentation and Usage

Detailed documentation will be provided explaining how to enable real-time feedback, customize progress indicators, and handle user interactions during task execution. Examples and best practices will also be included to guide users in integrating this feature into their workflows.

## Contribution and Collaboration

Enhancements to the real-time feedback feature will be guided by community feedback and contributions. The project will accept pull requests that improve the robustness, efficiency, and usability of the real-time feedback mechanisms.
