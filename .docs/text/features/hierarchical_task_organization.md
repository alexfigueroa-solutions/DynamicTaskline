### Hierarchical Task Organization

#### Feature Overview

Hierarchical Task Organization is a core feature of the DynamicTaskLine library, designed to manage complex command-line interfaces (CLI) workflows by structuring tasks in a parent-child relationship. This feature is crucial for maintaining clarity in CLIs that execute multiple interdependent operations.

#### Architectural Design

The architecture for Hierarchical Task Organization is built upon a composite design pattern, which treats individual tasks and groups of tasks uniformly. Each task is an object with its own properties and methods, and a "parent" task can contain multiple "child" tasks.

- **Task Object**: The basic building block that encapsulates the logic of a single task.
- **Task Manager**: A central coordinator that handles the execution and lifecycle of all tasks.
- **Task Tree**: A hierarchical representation of tasks where each node is a Task Object, and edges represent parent-child relationships.

#### Engineering Principles

The engineering of this feature follows SOLID principles, ensuring that each component is:

- **Single Responsibility**: Each task is responsible for a single piece of the workflow.
- **Open/Closed**: New types of tasks can be added without altering existing code.
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtasks can replace parent tasks without affecting the program's correctness.
- **Interface Segregation**: Task interfaces are specific to their functionality, avoiding forced dependencies.
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules do not depend on low-level modules but on abstractions.

#### Implementation Details

1. **Task Declaration**: Tasks are declared using decorators that specify their nature and relationship with other tasks.

```python
@manager.task(title="Main Task")
def main_task(data):
    pass

@manager.task(title="Sub Task", parent="Main Task")
def sub_task(data):
    pass
```

2. **Task Execution**: The Task Manager orchestrates task execution based on the defined hierarchy, ensuring that parent tasks are executed before their children.

3. **Data Handling**: Data produced by a parent task is passed to child tasks as arguments, enabling data flow through the task hierarchy.

4. **Status Reporting**: Each task reports its status to the Task Manager, which updates the CLI display in real-time to reflect task progress.

5. **Error Management**: Errors in tasks are caught and can be propagated up the hierarchy, triggering appropriate handling mechanisms.

#### Error Handling

A robust error-handling mechanism is integrated to gracefully manage failures:

- **Try-Except Blocks**: Each task is wrapped in try-except blocks to catch exceptions.
- **Error Propagation**: Upon catching an error, a task can propagate it to its parent, or handle it internally.
- **Recovery Procedures**: Options for retrying tasks, skipping, or aborting the entire workflow are provided.

#### Testing Strategies

Comprehensive testing ensures the reliability of hierarchical task execution:

- **Unit Tests**: Individual tasks are tested in isolation for expected behavior.
- **Integration Tests**: Combined parent-child task workflows are tested to ensure proper interaction.
- **Stress Tests**: Tasks are subjected to heavy loads and complex hierarchies to test performance under stress.

#### Use Cases

This feature can be applied in various scenarios, such as:

- **Build Systems**: Managing compilation, testing, and packaging in a structured manner.
- **Automation Scripts**: Orchestrating a sequence of system administration tasks.
- **Data Pipelines**: Structuring data processing tasks in a logical order.
