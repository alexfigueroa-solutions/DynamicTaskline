# Interactive Configuration Feature for DynamicTaskLine

The **Interactive Configuration** feature is designed to enhance the **DynamicTaskLine** library, enabling the dynamic adaptation and configuration of tasks in real-time according to user input. This feature ensures a more flexible and responsive Command-Line Interface (CLI) experience.

## Architectural Overview

The Interactive Configuration feature relies on a robust system for capturing user input and applying configuration changes to tasks at runtime. This system must integrate seamlessly with the existing task management and execution flow of **DynamicTaskLine**.

### Key Components

- **Input Manager**: Captures and processes user input in real-time.
- **Configuration Manager**: Applies the user's configuration choices to the tasks.
- **Task Updater**: Updates task parameters and state based on the configuration changes.

### Classes and Functions

- **`InteractiveConfig`**: A class dedicated to managing interactive inputs and updating task configurations.
- **`ConfigurableTask`**: A subclass of `Task` that supports dynamic configuration changes.

## Implementation Details

Interactive Configuration will be implemented by extending tasks to accept real-time input and modify their behavior accordingly. Hereâ€™s an illustrative implementation snippet:

```python
from dynamictaskline import TaskManager, Task
from dynamictaskline.interactive import InteractiveConfig

# Initialize the TaskManager with interactive capabilities
manager = TaskManager(interactive=True)

@manager.task(title="Configurable Main Task")
def main_task(config: InteractiveConfig):
    # Prompt user for configuration options
    user_choice = config.prompt("Choose an option: (a/b/c)", choices=['a', 'b', 'c'])
    config.apply(user_choice)

    # Task logic adapts based on the user's choice
    if config['choice'] == 'a':
        # Option A logic
    elif config['choice'] == 'b':
        # Option B logic
    else:
        # Option C logic

# Define an interactive subtask
@manager.task(title="Interactive Sub Task", parent="Configurable Main Task")
def sub_task(config: InteractiveConfig):
    # Subtask logic that can also adapt based on main task's or its own configurations
    pass

# Run the TaskManager
manager.run()
```

## Testing Scenarios

Testing will focus on the ability to:

- Capture user input accurately.
- Update task configurations and reflect changes in task behavior.
- Maintain task state consistency across configuration changes.

Both unit tests (testing individual components in isolation) and integration tests (testing the feature within the context of an entire task workflow) will be developed.

## Documentation and Best Practices

Detailed documentation will provide developers with instructions on:

- Defining configurable tasks.
- Utilizing the `InteractiveConfig` class for user prompts and configuration.
- Managing dependencies between task configurations.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions that improve user experience, enhance flexibility, or introduce new capabilities for task configuration will be welcomed. Standard contribution procedures will be encouraged to maintain code quality and consistency.
